For better documentation and reading experience we added special definitions for some main HTML elements. 
The HTML ```code``` element displays its contents styled in a fashion intended to indicate that the text is a short fragment of computer code.
The HTML ```pre``` element represents preformatted text which is to be presented exactly as written in the HTML file.

We also covered the behaviour of the HTML ```a``` element (or anchor element), with its href attribute, creates a hyperlink to web pages, files, email addresses, locations in the same page, or anything else a URL can address for consistency and better experience with the web typography.
